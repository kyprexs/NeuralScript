## 🎯 Vision

NeuralScript is designed to be the **fastest**, most **expressive**, and most **intuitive** language for numerical computing, data science, and machine learning. It combines:

- **Multi-paradigm design**: Functional, Object-Oriented, and Imperative programming styles
- **Native performance**: Compiles directly to optimized machine code
- **Mathematical expressiveness**: First-class tensors, matrices, and statistical distributions
- **Unicode support**: Write `∑`, `∂`, and `∇` directly in your code
- **Automatic differentiation**: Built into the compiler, not a library
- **Dimensional analysis**: Catch unit mismatches at compile time
- **GPU acceleration**: Seamless tensor operations on CUDA/OpenCL
- **Memory safety**: Rust-inspired ownership with garbage collection for convenience

## 🚀 Quick Example

```neuralscript
// Define a neural network layer with mathematical notation
struct DenseLayer<T: Numeric, const N: usize, const M: usize> {
    weights: Matrix<T, N, M>    // Compile-time shape checking
    biases: Vector<T, M>
    activation: Fn(T) -> T
}

impl<T, N, M> DenseLayer<T, N, M> {
    // Automatic differentiation built-in
    fn forward(&self, x: Vector<T, N>) -> Vector<T, M> {
        let linear = self.weights ⊙ x + self.biases  // Matrix multiplication with ⊙
        self.activation(linear)
    }
    
    // Generate backward pass automatically
    #[autodiff(forward)]
    fn backward() -> Self::Gradient { /* Generated by compiler */ }
}

// Parallel tensor operations with async/await
async fn train_model(data: Dataset<f32>, model: &mut DenseLayer<f32, 784, 10>) {
    for batch in data.batches(32).parallel() {
        let predictions = model.forward(batch.inputs)
        let loss = cross_entropy(predictions, batch.labels)
        
        // Automatic differentiation and optimization
        let gradients = ∇loss  // Unicode gradient operator
        model.apply_gradients(gradients, learning_rate: 0.001)
        
        println!("Loss: {loss:.4f}")
    }
}

// Unit checking prevents runtime errors
fn calculate_velocity(distance: Meter, time: Second) -> MeterPerSecond {
    distance / time  // Compiler ensures dimensional correctness
}
```
